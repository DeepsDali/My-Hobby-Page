            <li>Eggs:1 medium</li>
            <li>Butter: 225gm unsalted</li>
            <li>Lemon zest and 1tbsn lemon juice</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream to serve</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Method</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pastry: <br />Mix flour,salt and butter until the mixture
              resembles fine breadcrumbs.Stir in the icing sugar. Whisk egg yolk
              in ice-cold water and the lemon juice and stir this into the flour
              mixture. knead the dough, separate into 2 discs, wrap well and
              chill for 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Filling: <br />
              all ingredients in a large bowl. Once the pastry has chilled, roll
              a large piece of dough on a lightly dusted worktop into a roughly
              30cm circle. Use this to line the pie dish, leaving some overhang.
              Fill with the blueberry filling. Roll out the remaining pastry to
              the same size as your dish, cut out 8 strips, then arrange in a
              lattice on top of the filling. Press around the edges of the pie
              to join the lattice strips to the base, then trim any overhang and
              crimp the edges.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake: <br />Heat the oven to 170¬∞C fan/gas 5, putting a baking
              sheet in the oven. Brush the pastry with the beaten egg, then
              sprinkle with demerara sugar. Chill in the freezer for 10 minutes
              (or in the fridge for 20-30 minutes), then transfer the pie
              directly onto the hot baking sheet in the oven and bake for 50
              minutes or until the pastry is golden brown. Leave the pie to sit
              for 15 minutes or so, then serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice
              cream.

          <ul>
            <li>
              ‚ô• Always add a pinch of salt to the mix as salt sharpens flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚ô• To get more depth of flavor in your chocolate cakes, brownies,
              and cookies, add a teaspoon of espresso powder.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚ô• To make whipped cream extra fluffy, refrigerate your mixing bowl
              beforehand.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚ô• Don't want to wait a few hours for your straight-from-the-fridge
              butter to get to room temprature. Instead just warm a bowl in the
              microwave and then cover your butter with it for a few minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚ô• Sift your dry ingredients. It'll keep lumps at bay and ensure
              the ingredients get incorporated well.

              Go vegan in your baking by using plant-based milk, flour, and

            </li>
            <li>
              Use gluten-free options of flours made from grains like oats,
              millet, and quinoa, as well as nut flours like almond and coconut.
              These flours add unique flavours and textures to your baking and
              are also more nutritious.

            <li>
              Make sourdough bread as it's delicious and healthier with more
